The use of the build.xml Ant file to build, test, distribute, javadoc, and zip the PongLegacy project is as follows:

- Assume a "set home=E:\work\Java\ponglegacy" DOS environment.
- %home%\scripts\bat\ponglegacy.bat <target>

... where <target> can be one of the following. (No <target> defaults to "dist.")

The Ant build targets are:

Target	Depends			Actions
======	=======			=======
clean				Remove all build & temporary files  directories from the repository
dist				Build & distribute the PongLegacy distribution .jar file
test				Build & run the PongLegacy unit tests
docs				Build the PongLegacy javadoc website
run	dist			Build & run the PongLegacy distribution .jar file
all	dist, test, docs	Build _everything_ and put it in a .zip archive
