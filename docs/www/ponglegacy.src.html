      <td height="65"> This page contains the final project of Mr. Petty's 2009-2010 AP Computer Science class. It evolved from the classic video game, Pong. The game utilizes a combination of grueling coding and intuitive planning on the part of some of Winchester's greatest young programmers. The work shown here is the result of many hours of hard work and our hope is that future programmers can learn something from this. </td>

      <td>The goal of PongLegacy was to create a multiplayer version of the classic game &quot;Pong.&quot; Our goal was to have it be up to eight players in an octagon playing, as well as have each player run it from their own computer over a network. Currently, our goal is to get it working with two players locally, and then move on from there.</td>
